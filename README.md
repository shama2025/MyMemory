# MyMemory
This repository will be housing the FreeCodeCampe My Memory Android App tutorial. The purpose of this app was to learn about Mobile development and use it as a stepping stone to create my own projects. However, this project does not have a functional release due to conflicting versions and deprecated methods from the time of the video to today.
